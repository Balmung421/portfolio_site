      <h1>Campfire</h1>
      <p>
        The color of your fire will be different to those of your classmates.<br>
        Whatever color math decides for you, take it to heart and draft a poem<br>
        on how the fire makes you feel.<br>
        You have 10 min to draft, and 5 min to then read it aloud to yourself<br>
        or to others.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This fire was not made by me, but I wanted to see how it was made, since a piece of education tech<br>
        I am really interested in is the ability to use WebGL on the web.
        Once you draft a poem, I want you to be my classmate again and tell me how this could improve.<br>
        If you have any idea, model, or feeling you wanted to present this way, what would you want it to be?
